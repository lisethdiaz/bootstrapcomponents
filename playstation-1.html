        <i>The PlayStation 1</i> was conceived by a Song executive named Ken Kutaragi. Sony Computer Entertainment, Inc. (SCEI) was first established by Sony in Japan in 1993 to manage the company's projects in the video game industry. <i>The Original PlayStation</i> console was released on December 3, 1994, in Japan. It was a result of a partnership, in 1991, between it and Nintendo. It was later introduced and sold worldwide in 1995. It took the companys founding executive team about four years to develop the PlayStation console. The company had four different presidents during its time of development. This console was one of the only capable to produce 3D images and visuals. As well as containing masses of soundtracks, audios, game content and higher quality. Since the console was made for 3D visuals, 2D doesn’t look great. The console also launched with a controller, but it had yet to feature vibrations and analog sticks. It also featured a cartridge port for accepting Super Nintendo games. Many popular video games came with this <i>PlayStation</i> like the Wipeout series, Final Fantasy 7, Tekken franchise, Gran Turismo 1 and 2, Metal Gear Solid, Ape Escape, Spyro the Dragon series, the Crash Bandicoot franchise and more. <i>The PlayStation</i> was often compared to Nintendo because of the many features Nintendo had. Despite this, it became the first video gaming console to reach one hundred million shipments. During the time of its release, <i>the PlayStation</i> was about $299. As of now, the price of these consoles can range from $300 to almost $900 because they aren’t as common as they once were.
