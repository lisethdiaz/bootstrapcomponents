        <i>The PlayStation 2</i> development began quickly after the release of the first model of PlayStations. <i>The PlayStation 2</i> was first released on March 4, 2000 in Japan and would be sold in all other countries later that same year. It was developed and marketed by SCEI and was also sold for $299 during its time of release. Its price has yet to change. Its console was a hardware upgrade compared to its precursor. The new console supported both CDs and DVDs, which was very significant because DVD players were generally expensive during this time. The animation and visuals on video games and movies were smooth. It also featured backward-compatibility from Sony, which would allow you to continue playing with other PlayStation models and video games. The new controller also had added features and its sixth generations would be competition to Nintendo and Xbox controllers. Its new features included DualShock, different buttons, higher pressure sensitivity, and even specialized controllers for certain games; such as, Dragon Quest VIII, Final Fantasy X-2, Onimusha 3, and Resident Evil 4. <i>The PlayStation 2</i> also offered several games, such as Gran Turismo 4, Metal Gear Solid 2, Shadow of the Colossus, and the God of War titles. <i>The PlayStation 2</i> continues to be popular all around the world. Its production had been going strong for nearly thirteen years. Around 50 million units just in the United States and its European sales was over 40 million units. While its worldwide sales has reached over 100 million units.
